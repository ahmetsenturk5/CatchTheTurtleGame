## 🎮 Game Features

- Countdown timer (customizable by the player)
- Score tracking
- Welcome screen with time selection input
- Built using the `turtle` module (no external libraries needed)

## 🧠 About the Project

This game was inspired by [Atıl Samancıoğlu's Catch the Turtle Project](https://github.com/atilsamancioglu/P09-CatchTheTurtle).  
Some features and structure were adapted and improved based on his original idea. Thanks for the great resource!

### 🔧 Improvements over the original:
- Welcome screen with timer input using `screen.textinput()`
- Dynamic countdown based on player's choice (10 to 60 seconds)
- Code refactored for clarity and modularity
